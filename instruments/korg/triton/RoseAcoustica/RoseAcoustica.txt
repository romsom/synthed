                                  History

In April 2001, I released the Rose.pcg and RoseCOMBI.pcg. The main goal of
these programs were to provide Triton-users around the world with some free
sounds for their Workstation.
The release came as a big surprise to most users, who desperately had
searched the web for new, free sounds to work with. After this came RoseII
in May 2001... As I noticed that Triton-users continued to urge for more
sounds for their truly expensive equipment, the lack of time couldn´t stop
me creating more sounds. The sounds are handmade by me, using nothing else
than the Triton TouchScreen. It has made me look like Quasimodo...

Many of the users has complained about the lack of good pianos on Triton
and that patches often has a scent of special sounds like the ones used in
Dance/Trance/Techno...
This gave me the idea of making some sounds with a more Acoustic feeling -
sounds that can be used in many genres... This is the story behind
RoseAcoustica.
The RoseAcoustica gave me many ideas to work with Pianos, Guitars and
Brasses but also on different Strings and basses. But as before, I couldn´t
help making some sweeps and motionsynths - hope you like them regardless of
this.
It has been hard work making the sounds - not only the programming of them,
but the fact that every sound is playable made it hard to move on to the
next program...

                                Help needed!

As I´m about making an Arpeggiobank for the Triton, I would like to know
what kind of arps to concentrate on... Send me a message on the above
boards or to my email if you have any ideas...
If you also have any ideas what´s missing for the MOSS, I´ll gratefully
accept any recommendations...
And, please don´t hesitate to send me any feedback on this and my previous
releases, since that´s the only way for me to impove myself and, in the
long run, making better sounds for you all...

Best wishes,
Richard Rose
