SynthEd is in the prototype stage. We are using the Korg TRITON and Access VIRUS as an example for the prototype.

To install the Synthed prototype:

1. Download and install Python 2.2 from http://www.python.org
2. Download and install wxPython 2.4 for Python 2.2 from http://www.wxpython.org
3. Verify that a few of the wxPython sample programs work to check the baseline installation
4. A sample VIRUS .SYX file is now included in the instruments/access/virus_c/sysex subdirectory. 
5. Create a SYNTHED_HOME environment variable and set it to the directory where you installed SynthEd
6. Add the SynthEd home directory to the PYTHONPATH environment variable
7. Run Synthed. For example, under Windows, assuming that Synthed was installed in C:\synthed, open a command window and type:
    set SYNTHED_HOME=c:\synthed
    cd %SYNTHED_HOME%
    c:\python22\python synthed.py
From the File menu, Open a VIRUS .SYX file from the unzipped preload disk file. SynthEd will load the file and display a list of available banks. Select one of 
the SINGLE banks and the available patches in the bank will be displayed. Double-click one or more of the patches to try out the patch editor.
