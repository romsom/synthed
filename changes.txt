1. Eliminated the widget 'reference' attribute and changed the meaning 
of the 'decoder' attribute:

    Old: <widget class="ClassName" decoder="list" reference="list-1_2">
    New: <widget class="ClassName" decoder="list-1_2">

2. Added widget 'tip' attribute. Example:

    <widget class="CheckWidget" tip="This text will display in a tool tip.">
